/**
 * A fixed thread pool that accepts runnables to execute when threads are

 * <p>
 * The fastest path to shutting down the pool is: pool.shutdown(true).
 * Any items remaining on the queue and any items being worked on are clipped
 * and terminated as quickly as possible.
 * <p>
 * The cleanest (but longest) path to shutdown is the following sequence:
 * <ul>
 * <li>pool.stopAcceptingWork();
 * <li>pool.waitForQueueToEmpty(timeout, waitInterval);
 * <li>pool.shutdown(false);
 * <li>pool.waitUntilDone(timeout, timeUnit);
 * </ul>
 * This will finish all submitted and running work before terminating.
